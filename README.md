I am fond of designing different amplifier using different IC and specs. But always there is something new the amplifier. You can see my previous work on amplifier on my profile. Today I have an old 4440 amplifier which is integrated with bass boosted amplifier. this is very old amplifier IC which is very popular in mid-90’s and most of the car stereo systems are designed using this. LA4440 originally made by SANYO Tokyo company and has a max 19w output. Which is decreased to 6w per channel if used in stereo channel. I don’t know about the decrease in output but the info is given in the datasheet itself.

Features:
Thermal protection
Overvoltage protection
Short circuit protection
Low noise
Built in muting function
Voltage range (+/-12 volts)
This is an operation amplifier-based audio IC and the gain settings can be changed as per requirements, all the designing info is given the datasheet. I focused to make a 2.1 amplifier using this LA4440 IC.

Working of amplifier:

This is a 2.1 amplifier and the audio test is shared below. In the amplifier a lot of capacitor are used which is way too high for a low output. The circuit is properly designed using the datasheet and just modified the preamplifier section. The audio output on stereo channels in amazing but the bridge channels have a little distortion. Stereo channels are loud enough to make noise in large assembly hall. The low frequency output is not stable enough to drive any subwoofer at all. But a small bass with high speaker output can be used in systems like assembly hall purpose.

More modifications and upgrades:
The stereo is working great as stated above and next time I will modify the bridge bass channel by integrating the same circuit TDA2050 dual IC which gives a max subwoofer output of 50watts. Then using the same preamplifier section, I will test the bass. This amplifier designed is just a practice you can try more configuration all the schematics are shared in the description and embedded links in the post.
